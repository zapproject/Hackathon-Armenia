Implement Oracle + Futures Contract Dapp

Materials tailored to Ethereum + Nodejs but any Oracle-sourced Futures settlements welcome, platform-agnostic

Using OracleSkeleon.js, FuturesSkeleton.sol as reference connect a data provider( crypto exchange api for example) to a futures contract so that settlement is determined by oracle data

A frontend has been set up for binary futures testing here
https://github.com/zapproject/Hackathon-Armenia/tree/master/frontend

Feel free to provide expanded interface as needed.

Projects will be rated on performance, ingenuity, and scalable patterning

Serious bonuses for features like
    novel interface,
    SSL verification of oracle data,
    multiple data sources for oracles, fallback etc,
    oracle monetization,
    ERC20 payments,
    futures contract factories,
    oracle data(crypto exchange, etc)
